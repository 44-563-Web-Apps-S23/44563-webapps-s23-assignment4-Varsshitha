    <h3>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS
        BY
        HERMANN SUDERMANN
        </h3>
    <h4>ROSA</h4> <p>Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
too. I'm sure it's a trick!</p>

<h4>FRAU LINDEMANN</h4> <p>[_Looking out toward the back._]</p><p> Dear, dear, isn't that
Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
does he always want up here?</p>

<h4>ROSA</h4> <p>[_Pointedly._]</p><p>He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
here all day.</p>

<h4>FRAU LINDEMANN</h4> <p>That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
knew how I could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only
way to manage it!</p>

     <p>[STRÜBEL _enters. He is a handsome young fellow without much
     polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
     invariably good-natured._</p>

<h4>STRÜBEL</h4> <p>Good day, everybody.</p>

<h4>FRAU LINDEMANN</h4><p>[_Sarcastically._]</p> <p>Charming day.</p>

<h4>STRÜBEL</h4> <p>[_Surprised at her coolness._]</p><p>I say! What's up? Who's been
rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please.</p> <p>[_Sits
down._]</p> <p>Pestiferously hot this afternoon.</p>

<h4>FRAU LINDEMANN</h4> <p>[_After a pause._]</p><p>H'm, H'm.</p>
